			Do need XMLreader? - currently using TextReader/Writer

			Next need to try binding buttons with a TextAdd Command.
			Need more understanding of CommandParameter and [CallerMemberName]
			It's between this or just continuing with the button.tag passing info to the method.

			Now need to add spectype or speciality tags to Diagnosis objects.
			Then filter view of buttons by those tags (hardcode a tag to begin with )

			Then need to separate object of single diagnosis with whole text-edited report.
			Should be able to edit diagnosis test and offer save over or save as varient.
			Then add it to main report text.
			Textbox should switch views by binding to a view controler object which has current display text.

			Then need to develop search-as-type autocomplete combobox filtered by tag and perhaps ordered by usage frequency (later)
			
			Eventually convert text to flow document, with different coloured text to show changes/diffs and option of formatting/images etc.

			Develop command system for button and keyboard shortcut binding.  UIRoutedCommand seems to be the one.
			Need Save-over, save-as-varient, Save-as-new, AddReportText, Undo/Redo (could just track state of DiagnosisText and ReportText objects, and XML persistence objects)
			TextBox has good native undo/redo.  Need separate undo/redo system for save/clear diagnoses and add to dictionary.

			Additional user dictionary (compiled or not?) with add to dictionary and export function.

MenuItem item = new MenuItem();
item.Header = "Add to Dictionary";
item.Click += new RoutedEventHandler(AddDict_Click);
item.Command = EditingCommands.IgnoreSpellingError;
item.CommandParameter = currentText;
item.CommandTarget = txtBox;

Just need the logic to open the Dictionary file and write the element in CommandParameter to the fil
